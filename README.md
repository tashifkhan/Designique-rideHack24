**Problem Statement**

The fashion industry in India is booming, but a significant gap exists between designers, institutions, and manufacturers. Many talented designers struggle to access affordable production facilities and effective distribution channels, while institutions face challenges in scaling their production needs efficiently.

**Solution**

Designique aims to bridge this critical B2B gap by establishing a reputable marketplace that connects key stakeholders. Our platform enables designers to turn their creative visions into reality, assists institutions in scaling their production needs efficiently, and helps manufacturers optimize their capacity and increase profitability.

**Key Features**

- **Designer Portal**: Provides a showcase opportunity for designers to display their creations, offering them for purchase or licensing. This portal serves as a digital stage to highlight their talent to a broader audience.
- **Marketplace**: Integrates e-commerce capabilities, allowing customers to browse and order a wide range of clothing items directly, supporting both custom and standard apparel.

**Unique Selling Points**

- Facilitates direct negotiation with manufacturers, offering designers flexibility and favorable terms for their clothing lines.
